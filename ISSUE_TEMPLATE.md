[JIRA tickets](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=-4&jql=component%20%3D%20%22Desktop%20App%22%20order%20by%20created%20DESC) are created for all valid bug reports filed here. Bugs and features that the Mattermost core team are not immediately working on are opened as [Help Wanted GitHub issues](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/contribution-checklist/) and welcome to contributions. 

Our goal is to bring the Mattermost desktop repository into our day-to-day internal process with the hope of having more frequent desktop releases with faster feature development and turnaround time on bug fixes.
